  <h1>yFiles Known Issues</h1>

  <p>
  The API documentation in the <code>doc/api/html/</code> directory may not work
  properly in Chrome.
  <br/>
  <b>Solution:</b>
  Firefox has no problems.
  Alternatively, you can view the <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/Index.html">API documentation online</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Due to strict cross domain policies in both <b>Internet Explorer</b> and <b>Google Chrome</b>, many demos work only partially or not at all when viewed from
a filesystem location in these browsers. The preferred workaround is to access the samples through a web server instead. Google chrome can also
be instructed to use a more tolerant policy by starting <code>chrome.exe</code> with the <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> command line option. Also, Firefox has no such problems.
