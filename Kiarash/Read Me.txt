notes: 

-In Tiffany's reseach Weka is used for cross-validation (She didn't make the actual Bayesian networks). To do similar thing we need the Weka software. but If we want to build the bayesian networks, in order to further compare the bayesian networks, we might want to use similar code to HIVMultinetBuilder.java or Multinet.zip; in this case we still need two jar files - to be downloaded from Weka website.

-To understand what Tiffany has done, reading her thesis seems to be useful. 

-Neena's pipeline is explained in GEO_TBIpaper8_V2.pdf.
