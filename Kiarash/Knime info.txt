Knime: http://www.knime.org/knime-desktop
Highly recommended: Yed Yfiles API (for html):
http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yfileshtml_about.html


All are free to install:
Knime.org along with weka and r add-ons:

http://www.knime.org/knime-desktop

We can get it to automatically run a workflow and save nice

reports for you automatically (and nicer graphs/pics compared to Weka)...

These extensions may be useful too:

http://www.knime.org/downloads/extensions

(e.g. the weka and R)

Some of these might be useful with time as well:

If workflow example not loading (error), it can mean that one of the
extensions is not installed...

Good starting points:

These workflow examples are in the publicserver_workflows zip file
(http://www.knime.org/knime_downloads/publicserver/publicserver_workflows.zip).
 If you put together the various items from examples below, I think
you will be almost done with the pipeline that you need...

Good workflow for comparing different machine learning models and
plotting best scoring one:Load this example into Knime:

Good workflow for clustering: Load this example into Knime: 050002_CreditScoring

High-throughput screening example may be useful (on knime site:
http://www.knime.org/virtual-high-throughput-screening)


How to do feature selection/elimination:

See this example under publicserver_workflows:
002004_Feature-Elimination_with_NaiveBayes

Cross validation:

See this example under publicserver_workflows: 002003_Cross-Validation_with_SVM

To implement cross validation: Would need to add feature selection
(they call it feature elimination) inside the CV loop so that it
doesn't see whole data
