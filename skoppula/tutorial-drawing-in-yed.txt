Create a two column spreadsheet in which the first column contains the parents and 
the second column contains the children (see below). Open yED, choose your spreadsheet,
 and then [on the window that will be open] "adopt" the data range, and again "adopt" 
 the first column as source and second as target.

The Excel sheet looks something like this:

	alcohol induced liver 	xanthine synthesis
	alcohol induced liver 	melanosome localization
	alcohol induced liver 	xylan metabolism
	alcohol induced liver 	flavonoid phytoalexin anabolism
	alcoholism	alcohol induced liver disorder
	alcoholism	siderophore anabolism, peptide biosynthesis

Other projects that I started are already taken by other students like Vinnie, 
Tiffany, etc. so you can ask them where the programs are.
