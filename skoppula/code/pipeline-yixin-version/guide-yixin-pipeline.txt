This document is a brief manual on how to perform predictive pathway analysis - 
that is, our implementation of it - the Pipeline program. This document references 
code that can be found in this directory and on BCL's GitHub under GroupData/Skanda.
The pipeline and documentation was maintained by Yixin Zhu.

If you need clarification, notice any errors, or encounter any problems, 
please feel free to contact Skanda (skoppula@andover.edu). 
I would be more than happy if you have improvements or additions. Enjoy!

1. You can learn how to use our pipeline by running the pipeline with 
	the --help parameter. All other parameters will be ignored if you use this:
	
		java -jar pipeline.jar --help
		
2. The --fast parameter is a simple way to convert .raw to .arff, especially good for
	large files. However, it will only do the following changes:
	
        Replace "NA" to "?"
        Replace " " to ",", like a csv file
        Generate the @attribute part(only all the SNPs, SEX and PHENOTYPE), but 
			the value are all {0, 1, 2}
        Generate the @relation part based on parameter
        Generate the @data part.
	
	If you use this parameter: 
		The --src, --des, and --name parameters are ALWAYS NECESSARY:
			--srcR or --srcA specifies the path of the .raw/.arff file
			--des specifies the path of the .arff file. If file exists, the program
				will ask whether to overwrite it; if the file didn't exist but the
				directory existed, it will automatically create new file; if neither
				the file or directory exists, it will give the error. In the mean 
				time, when the program doesn't use the fast method(--fast), it will
				also create a file with same name as --des specified but end with
				.temp, which is the temp file only record all the instances with the
				necessary SNPs .list file requires.
			--name(necessary for raw file) gives the relation name for the .arff file.
				The name can be separated by blank.
			--list(necessary for arff file) gives the .list file path.
				The names of the SNPs in this file don't need to be the same 
				order as .raw file.

3. --test replaces all the{0, 1}, {0, 2} and {1, 2} in SNPs with {0, 1, 2}
4. You can find two sample input files in:
		/code/pipeline-yixin-version/testForRaw.list
	and
		/code/pipeline-yixin-version/testForRaw.raw
		
	For example, you can run the pipeline with these parameters via:
		java -jar pipeline.jar --srcR testForRaw.raw --des outForRaw.arff --list testForRaw.list --name MajorDepression --test
		
	The corresponding output of this can be found in:
		/code/pipeline-yixin-version/sample-output.txt
