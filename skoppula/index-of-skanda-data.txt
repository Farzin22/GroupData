This document is a brief listing of the used in my project. This document references
wdata that can be found in this directory and on BCL's GitHub under GroupData/Skanda.

This document now includes documentation on data that Amin recently acquired 
from dBGAP. Also, part of this data repository may be missing when hosted on DropBox
and GitHub because of space limitations. To get complete data refer to the original 
sources found in the text below (email skoppula@andover.edu if not specified).

If you need clarification, notice any errors, or encounter any problems, 
please feel free to contact Skanda (skoppula@andover.edu). 
I would be more than happy to include improvements or additions. Enjoy!

Note from Amin: All data for projects that use GEO data is in:
	gil@mendel:/scratch/ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALCOHOLISM
	/data/Alcoholism/COGA
		/data/Alcoholism/COGA/coga-snp-partition-files
			The set of SNP lists used in WGAViewer to generate the SNP to gene mapping
		/data/Alcoholism/COGA/coga005-reduced.arff
			A subset of the full COGA data, used for program testing
		/data/Alcoholism/COGA/coga-superreduced.arff
			An even smaller subset of the full COGA data, used for program testing
		/data/Alcoholism/COGA/coga-sync-complete-SNPlist.csv
			The complete list of features for the COGA data (in COGA's case, the list 
			of SNPs). File is one line and SNPs are comma seperated.
		/data/Alcoholism/COGA/coga-sync-complete-SNPlist.wr
			The complete list of features for the COGA data (in COGA's case, the list 
			of SNPs). File is many line and SNPs are line seperated.
		/data/Alcoholism/COGA/distributed...
			Folder containing a set of text files; each text file contains a unique 
			list of SNPs that together, comprise of the list of SNPs in the COGA
			and COGEND datasets
		
	/data/Alcoholism/COGEND
		/data/Alcoholism/COGEND/cogend-snp-partition-files
			The set of SNP lists used in WGAViewer to generate the SNP to gene mapping			
	
	/data/Alcoholism/pathway-to-snp-mapping
		A text file listing the relevant SNPs in corresponding to the genes in each
		pathway
		
	/data/Alcoholism/snp-to-gene-mapping
		A 1:1 SNP to gene mapping for each feature (SNPs) in the COGA dataset
	
	You can find other COGA/COGEND data on CSAIL's Safar maching under*:
			/scratch/koppula/data
		and
			/scratch/James/Random
			
I just posted a jar with all of the code into /scratch/James/all-files
on the safar machine. The relevant directories in the jar file are
"alcohol" and "run." The PLINK file that we began with (including
samples from all three datasets and the full set of close to 1 million
SNPs) and the two files with environmental variables (phs...) are also
in that directory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA
	/data/Lung-Cancer/Boston
		/data/Lung-Cancer/Boston/Lung_Boston_collapsed_symbols.arff
			A lung cancer data from a Boston lab
		
		/data/Lung-Cancer/Boston/lung-boston-superreduced.arff
			A reduced (subset) of the aforementioned data
		
		/data/Lung-Cancer/Boston/lung-boston-reduced-circadian.arff
			A super-reduced version of Lung_Boston_collapsed_symbols.arff with 
			6 features. Not sure why this is named circadian - circadian pattern genes?
		
	/data/Lung-Cancer/Michigan
		/data/Lung-Cancer/Michigan/Lung_Michigan_collapsed_symbols.arff
			A lung cancer data from a Michigan lab
			
	/data/Lung-Cancer/broad.mit.edu_LUAD.Genome_Wide_SNP_6.Level_3.84.2001.0
		Miscellaneous data that was found on TCGA, which we thought might be useful
		
	You can find other LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA data on Safar under:
			/scratch/koppula/data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALZHEIMERS
	/data/Alzheimers/alzheimers-partial-dbgap-data
		/data/Alzheimers/alzheimers-partial-dbgap-data/adjusted-phenotype.fam
			[PLINK-related] FAM file with data from dBGAP. Phenotypic information
			IS encoded in the data in this file.
		
		/data/Alzheimers/alzheimers-partial-dbgap-data/phs000168.LOAD610K_Phenotypes.GRU.txt
			Data from 3007 samples.
			The phenotypic information can be found here was used to fill in the
			aforementioned FAM file.
			
		/data/Alzheimers/alzheimers-partial-dbgap-data/command.sh
			This script was used to transfer the phenotypic information from the 
			the 5th column of phs000168.LOAD610K_Phenotypes.GRU.txt to
			adjusted-phenotype.fam. Amin notes that this might need to be used for 
			the data of other diseases.
			
		/data/Alzheimers/alzheimers-partial-dbgap-data/test.sh
			General version of the aforementioned script
			
		Note: Data should contain about 3007 samples, of which 2692 samples should be
				labeled as 'white' (i.e. coded as '1' in the 'Race' column)

ADHD
	/data/ADHD/
		/data/ADHD/ADHD_PLINK_unique_samples.***

			A compressed folder of original Safar folder (see note)
		
	Note: Data taken from Safar from /scratch/ldat/adhd/v2/genotype_calls/PLINK
			The transposed .tped file could not be decompressed due to size
			limitations. As indicated by the README, the data's duplicate pair 
			be found on Safar in the aforementioned directory.

SCHIZOPHRENIA
	/data/Schizophrenia
