The authors would thank Dr. Mike E. Weale from University College London for help in the population stratification module.  

The authors also thank Darin London, Robert J. Wagner, and Mark R DeLong from Duke Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy for their work on setting up the Mart for IGSP Data from Association Studies (MIDAS).  WGAViewer uses the query engine provided by the Biomart Data Integration System (http://www.biomart.org/).  The MIDAS data are also accessible from the MIDAS BioMart instance at http://midas.genome.duke.edu/biomart/martview.
