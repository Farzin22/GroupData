This tool has been included for when the user wants to look into specific SNPs without a WGA result set.  The function of this tool is very similar to the SNP annotation procedures in WGAViewer, except that no WGA results (P values) are involved.

To do this, click on menu "Tools -> Annotate a SNP".  Fill up the consequent input dialogs, for example, as in Figure 48, to annotate SNP rs9264942, with an up- and down-stream span of 100kbp, and a genotype-expression association test with gene HLA-C.  This will result in a typical SNP annotation as discussed in this user guide (section 3.3.2.c, Figure 21), however with no WGA results involved.
