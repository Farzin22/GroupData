All the data sets, figures, and interactive features during a work session can be saved to a binary ".wga" file.  To do this, click "File -> Save work".  To open the saved work session file, click "File->Open saved work".  If you annotate further after loading a saved work session, you need to save the further work to another work session file and load them separately.

If you load your work session file, you don't need to load the text data set file (.wr) separately.

If you only load your work session file to view and perform no further annotation, the program does not need the internet connection to do so.
