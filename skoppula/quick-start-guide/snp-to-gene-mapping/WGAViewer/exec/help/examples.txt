To illustrate this software, we use our recently completed study on host control of HIV-1 viral load during the asymptomatic set point period (Fellay et al. 2007) as an example (CHAVI_SETPOINT_SCIENCE).  All the illustrations in this documentation are based on this example. 

To load this example, click on menu "File->Open an example dataset". Two types of datasets are released with this package. One is the pre-annotation dataset (.wr file, text-based) and the other is the post-annotation dataset (.wga file, binary). This real dataset is based on the Illumina HumanHap 550K SNP chip.

For demonstrating the usage of multiple databases discussed later in this user guide, we also include a simulated dataset (Illumina_HumanHap300_sim.wr) in this software package.  This is a simulated set based on Illumina HumanHap 300K.
