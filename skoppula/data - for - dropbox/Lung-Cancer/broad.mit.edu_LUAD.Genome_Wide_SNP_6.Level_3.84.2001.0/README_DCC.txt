The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a project of the National Cancer Institute and the National Human
Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), is the foundation of a large-scale collaborative effort to
understand the genomic changes that occur in cancer. For more information, see
http://cancergenome.nih.gov/dataportal/index.asp.

The files in this archive contain data derived from tissue samples of patients that were diagnosed
with Lung adenocarcinoma. The data was produced by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
(broad.mit.edu) Cancer Genomic Characterization Center (CGCC) using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human
SNP Array 6.0 platform.

This archive is the 2001st revision of the 84th archive and contains only Level 3
(segmented/interpreted) data.

The MANIFEST.txt lists all the files, and their MD5 signatures, that should be included in this
complete archive.

A DESCRIPTION.txt file may be included by the submitting center that provides details about the data
files included in this archive.

The TCGA Data Primer provides an in depth description of TCGA data enterprise including data
classification and organization (including data types and data levels), how to access the data, and
a description of some possible ways to aggregate TCGA data.
