you don't need your own github account. 

you need to install Git Bash. (choose your OS on this page: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git and do as it says.)

then you need to clone this repository to your computer. you might decide to use SSH but for simplicity here we use HTTPS. 

go to Bash and navigate to where you want the codes to be on your computer. then type:
git clone https://github.com/bcl2group/GroupData


now you should have a folder called GroupData. Prefarably make a separate folder with your name and put your data or modify data. 

regularly, when you change or add codes, do this : 

git add . -A
git commit -m "a message containing what change you made"
git push

here you need to put username/password. ask us for that.
