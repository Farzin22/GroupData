You don't need your own github account. 

1. Install Git Bash. (choose your OS on this page: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git and do as it says)

2. Clone this repository to your computer (you might decide to use SSH but for simplicity here we use HTTPS). That is, 
    go to Bash and navigate to where you want the code to be on your computer. Type:
      git clone https://github.com/bcl2group/GroupData

3. Now you should have a folder called GroupData. You should make a separate folder with your name
    and put your [modified] data. 

4. Do this regularly, when you change or add code: 

      git pull  
        NOTE: You might want to do this more frequently so you have the repository's latest code
        NOTE: Make sure to do it just before pushing too!
      git add . -A
      git commit -m "a message containing what change you made"
      git push

Type the lab's username or password, or your own (see below). Ask us for that.

ALTERNATIVELY:

If you have your own github account that you prefer to use, you can add yourself as collaborator in bcl2group 
(you need the password to do this). Then clone the repository using its address. When you are pushing stuff 
to Git, however, you can to enter your own Git user/pass. This is actually nicer since we can see who has changed
which code and what...

To add yourself as collaborator go to github.com and log in as bcl2group and *add colaborator*
(look around a bit!...you'll find it)
