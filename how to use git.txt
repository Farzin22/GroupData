you don't need your own github account. 

you need to install Git Bash. (choose your OS on this page: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git and do as it says.)

then you need to clone this repository to your computer. you might decide to use SSH but for simplicity here we use HTTPS. 

go to Bash and navigate to where you want the codes to be on your computer. then type:
git clone https://github.com/bcl2group/GroupData


now you should have a folder called GroupData. Prefarably make a separate folder with your name and put your data or modify data. 

regularly, when you change or add codes, do this : 

git add . -A
git commit -m "a message containing what change you made"
git push

here you need to put username/password. ask us for that.



ALTERNATIVELY:

if you have your own github account that you prefer to use, you can add yourself as collaborator in bcl2group (you need the password to do this) and then clone it using the same address but when you are pushing stuff to the git, you need to enter your own git user/pass. This is actually nicer since we can see who has changed which code and what... 

for noobs (like the rest was not for them :p) : 

to add yourself as collaborator go to github.com and log in as bcl2group and *add colaborator*
